### FoodTruckProject

#### Description
This program was designed to take in user input about 5 food trucks. Asking for the name, the food type they served, and the rating of the food truck. With this information we listed out the truck information, as well as finding the average of the 5 trucks, and the highest rated food truck.

#### Lessons Learned
This project more difficult for me than I had anticipated. A lot of my struggles came from a null.pointer.expection error that occurred when compiling my code. The error was caused by a null value in my array, however I wasn't able to find a good solution on how to fix this error other than to use an Arrylist which I am not yet familiar with.
